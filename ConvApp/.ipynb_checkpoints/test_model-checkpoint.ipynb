        "1       The role of Supreme Court Justice requires an individual who is capable of making impartial judgements based on the laws of the United States. Much like a referee of a sporting event the Justice should be able to make a decision based on the rules no matter what their personal bias may be. That Scalia chose to use his office as a public forum for making political commentary on an issue that was not before the court is highly inappropriate and demonstrates that he lacks the judicial temperament that is essential for a Justice of the Supreme Court. If he is unable to restrain himself from making such unsolicited political comments it would be advisable for him to resign his present position and seek employment at Fox News where such behavior is considered to be the acceptable norm. \n",
        "2 I don't know how you disprove that race is a factor in theory when stopping someone and then asking for their citizenship status, unless you disallow it as a primary reason for the stop, and then are required to ask everyone the same questions. Still, there is no way to disprove that race is not a factor in practice, although I'm certain there must be other behavioral factors that can be used to detect when a person is concealing something, such as citizenship status, and therefore warrants further investigating. But there is also no need to disprove that race *isn't* a factor; it must be proven that it is. Well-written laws and processes should prevent most reasons to question the motive. If Arizona and other states employ other methods to determine whether a person's citizenship is in question, then there should be no problem. Yes, a person's appearance is readily apparent to a law enforcement officer, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was used as a factor in determining whether that person's status should be investigated further. I suspect that many who oppose this law in general oppose any checks on immigration at all, especially for our neighbors to the south. This can usually be determined by the person's continued and inaccurate use of the term \"anti-immigration\" when referring to these laws or the people who support them. The proper term is \"anti-illegal immigration\", which is something to which everyone should be opposed, I would think.\n",

        " The loophole described in the referenced LA Times article is that the H1B's are supplied by contract employers, so that the company which is concerned about reputation can claim they do not hire H1B's without a skills need, or even at all.Increasingly, American companies outsource their risks, and their ethics, to give short shrift to their workers.  They dispense with even a probationary period for new hires, instructing at them at last stages of the hiring process to sign on with a contractor *even though they recruit and interview directly*.They collude as to what compensation would be for similar skills, not by meeting in back rooms filled with cigar smoke, but by sharing consultant firms who survey their entire industry.This affects workers all the way up to PhD level engineering staff.  Executive levels, on the other hand, negotiate contracts which provide even for comfortable exits should that be needed.When certain folks in our political discourse contend that there is a functioning labor market such that if we acquire training and skills, we can go down the street, or even the next state, to trade our skills and knowledge for our compensation, I laugh.  It is not a functioning free market for labor.  It's fixed by these practices, and by others like no-compete clauses and often  unwritten no-poach agreements between related firms.\n",
        "1 Come on, it is inmigration (this particular program), and tax, and trade policies, and laws supressing organized labor: A huge tide affecting American workers.\"Congress surely did not want to give companies a more efficient means of slashing payroll costs while pushing more people to the curb.\"I may be called cynical but I am certain somebody saw it coming and chuckled. \n",
        "2 The most important thing that Congress can do to address this problem would be to repeal Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Senator Moynihan's \"gift to IBM\" has kept on giving for far too long. To continue to single out tech workers for exclusion from independent contractor status unless they are employed by a third-party contractor is unfair, as well as anti-innovation and anti-entrepeneurial. From Wikipedia: \"Introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Section 1706 added a subsection (d) to Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, which removed \"safe harbor\" exception for independent contractor classification (which at the time avoided payroll taxes) for workers such as engineers, designers, drafters, computer professionals, and \"similarly skilled\" workers.If the IRS determines that a third-party intermediary firm's worker previously treated as self-employed should have been classified as an employee, the IRS assesses substantial back taxes, penalties and interest on that third-party intermediary company, though not directly against the worker or the end client.[10] It does not apply to individuals directly contracted to clients.\"\"Safe harbor\" is a term for a situation in which someone is assumed to have met a certain requirement by meeting a broader requirement; e.g., the safe harbor for avoiding IRS underpayment of tax penalties is paying taxes of the smaller of the amount owed for the previous tax year or 90% of the amount owed for the current year.\n",

She was correct then, but what has caused the recent about-face?  She must have misread the tea leaves?   She has now temporarily recalibratd, but it is too little too late.  It is mind-boggling that she has not considered national security implications and implications of  law and order.  The EU needs a better leader - a leader who has a better grasp of the needs of the EU and who can mitigate the risks that the EU clearly faces.    \n"
